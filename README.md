# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Overview 
AutosRUs’ is a car manufacturer. The newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles hindering the manufacturing team’s progress. This analytics is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

_This analysis includes:_

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
